# DESIGN — Alex K Bells

Tokens are defined once in `src/app/globals.css` (`@theme`). This file explains
how to use them.

## Principles

- Monochrome, editorial, athletic. Confidence comes from type and space, not effects.
- Rules (lines) and solid black bands structure the page; avoid card grids.
- Square corners. No pills, gradients, neon, glows, floating widgets or fake badges.
- Motion is limited to colour and small underline/arrow transitions (≤200 ms), a 220 ms fade-up when a booking step changes (`animate-step-in`; not on the first step at page load), and a slight press on primary buttons. Filled buttons move down 1 px while pressed. All of it is disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`. The hero video autoplays and loops with a pause button, except under `prefers-reduced-motion`, where it shows the still poster until the visitor presses play.

## Colour

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ink` | #0b0b0b | Text on light; header, dark bands, footer |
| `ink-soft` | #1c1c1b | Hover on ink buttons |
| `paper` | #f6f4ef | Default warm off-white background |
| `surface` | #ece9e2 | Alternating light band |
| `white` | #ffffff | Hover on light-on-dark buttons |
| `line` | #d6d2c9 | Decorative dividers on light (never text) |
| `line-inverse` | #333331 | Dividers on ink |
| `muted` | #57544e | Secondary text on light |
| `muted-inverse` | #a9a59d | Secondary text on ink |

Measured contrast: ink/paper 17.9:1 · muted/paper 6.9:1 · muted/surface 6.2:1 ·
muted-inverse/ink 8.0:1. All text pairs pass WCAG AA (most pass AAA).

The only non-monochrome colour is the amber preview marker (`#b45309`) shown
in `CONTENT_PREVIEW` builds — it must never appear on production.

## Typography

One variable family: **Archivo** (Google Fonts via `next/font`, self-hosted at build), weight + width axes.

| Utility | Use |
|---|---|
| `font-display` | 800 weight, 112% width, uppercase, -0.02em — all headings |
| `text-display` | Hero / closing CTA (30 → 84 px) |
| `text-display-split` | Hero headline beside media at `lg+` (40 → 60 px), sized so each sentence fits on one line in half the grid |
| `text-h1` | Inner page titles (28 → 64 px) |
| `text-h2` | Section titles (24 → 44 px) |
| `text-h3` | Sub-headings (20 → 24 px) |
| `text-lede` | Intro paragraphs (17 → 20 px, 1.55) |
| `eyebrow` | 12 px, 600, 0.16em tracking, uppercase labels |

Body: 16 px / 1.6, sentence case. Keep paragraphs ≤ ~65ch (`max-w-xl`/`max-w-2xl`).
Display sizes were tuned so the longest word ("CUMBERNAULD") fits at 320 px.

## Layout & spacing

- `container-page`: max 78rem; gutters 16 / 24 / 40 px.
- Section rhythm: `py-16 sm:py-24 lg:py-28`; compact `py-10 sm:py-14`.
- 12-column grid at `lg`; always declare `grid-cols-1` on mobile grids (prevents min-content blowout).
- Section tones alternate paper → ink → paper → surface; avoid two identical tones adjacent except CTA → footer.
- Breakpoints: Tailwind defaults plus `2xs` (22.5rem / 360px) and `xs` (26rem / 416px).

## Components

| Component | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SiteHeader` | `components/layout` | Sticky ink bar; logo, nav, one CTA. Nav = Alex's four questions (Ways to train · Why kettlebells · About Alex · How to book → homepage anchors) from 1280 px; below that a Menu button, which also lists Group classes, One-to-one & online, Online coaching and Contact. All header targets ≥44 px |
| `DesktopNav` / `MobileNav` | `components/layout/NavLinks.tsx` | `aria-current`; full-height disclosure panel below the header; Esc closes and returns focus to the toggle; closes on navigation and on any link tap (same-page section links included) |
| `SiteFooter` | `components/layout` | Brand, nav, address, verified contact only. Explore lists the pages plus How to book (`footerNav`); no Home (the logo links home) and no homepage section links (they're in the header menu). Mobile: Explore column sized to content beside Contact + Find us; links ≥44 px below `lg` |
| `Logo` | `components/layout` | `variant="mark"` (header) or `"lockup"` (footer) from `site.logo`; plain-text name fallback if null |
| `Carousel` | `components/ui` | Client component. Swipe carousel below `lg`, three-column grid from `lg`. Native CSS scroll-snap (`snap-x snap-mandatory`, no `touch-action` override, so vertical page scroll still works over it; `overscroll-x-contain`); the list is focusable (arrow keys scroll it) and breaks out of the page gutters, scrolling inside itself so the page never overflows sideways. Dots and arrows mirror and move the scroll position; under `prefers-reduced-motion` they jump instead of gliding. `aria-roledescription="carousel"` only while it actually scrolls; a polite live region speaks the card name only after an arrow or dot is used |
| `ButtonLink` | `components/ui` | `primary` / `secondary` / `text` × `light` / `dark` tones; min 44–48 px targets; external links announce new tab. Focus ring takes the surface colour (`ink` on light, `paper` on dark) so it shows outside filled buttons |
| `Section`, `SectionHeading` | `components/ui` | Tone + spacing; heading ids wire `aria-labelledby` |
| `Provisional` | `components/ui` | Content approval gate |
| `PageHeader` | `components/sections` | Inner-page h1 block. Optional `image` (`site.pageImages`): desktop only (lg+), 4:5, four columns on the right, sitting on the header's bottom rule; art-directed `<picture>`: eager and high priority on desktop (it is usually the largest element there), a 1×1 placeholder below lg so phones and tablets download nothing |
| `Timetable` | `components/sections` | Driven by `content/classes.ts`. `layout="row"` (three across), `"stack"` (one per row, for narrow columns) or `"compact"` (one slim line per session, day left and time right, for the offer cards). Day and time share one line on phones (both layouts) and in `stack`; in the narrow desktop card the part-of-day label is visually hidden (still read by screen readers) |
| `PriceList` | `components/sections` | Only publishable prices; otherwise "Get in touch for current pricing". `linkContact={false}` where a "Start your training" button sits right below |
| `Location`, `Faq`, `CtaBand`, `JsonLd` | `components/sections` | |
| `BookingWizard`, `OnlineOnboarding` | `components/booking` | Step journeys: `Stepper` (bar per step; on phones only the current step is named), one step at a time, `ActionBar` (Back + Continue; sticky at the bottom of the screen below `lg`; Continue disabled with a hint until the step is complete), summary with "Change" links (sticky aside on desktop, one-line list on phones) |
| `ChoiceGroup` | `components/booking/ui.tsx` | Native radios/checkboxes as square tiles: white with a `muted` border (≥3:1), ink border on hover, solid ink when selected, outline on keyboard focus. `list` rows (≥56 px) or wrapping `chips` (≥48 px) |
| `AvailabilityCalendar` | `components/booking` | Monday-first month grid in hairline `line` cells (48–56 px tall). Available: bold with a dot; fully booked: muted and struck through; no sessions: muted; selected: solid ink. Times listed beside (desktop) or below (phones). Disabled dates are skipped by arrow keys |
| `WaysToTrain` | `components/sections` | One ink landmark (`#ways-to-train`), heading included, so it reads as a single block after the paper hero; on phones the edge-to-edge hero video runs straight into it (no paper strip). Heading ("What I offer" / "Choose how you train") with the one-line intro beside it on desktop (town from `site.location`), then a hairline. The three services are open columns, not boxed cards: a portrait photo (square on phones, 4:5 from `sm`; the existing greyscale training stills; online coaching reuses the single-bell hold until it has its own) with the number and name set over a decorative ink fade at its foot, then one line, price list, an **Enquire →** button (named for the service for screen readers; goes to /contact) and a Details text link. Photos ease in 3% on hover (motion-safe only). Below `lg` the columns are a swipe carousel (`Carousel`): 86% of the screen wide (max 28 rem; 24 rem from `sm`) so the next one peeks in, native scroll-snap, pagination dots and previous/next arrows (all 44 px targets). From `lg` they are three equal columns with a 2 rem gap and no controls. The group column lists the class times with `Timetable layout="compact"` |
| `HowToBook` | `components/sections` | "Where and how to book": three numbered steps (choose, message Alex on Instagram, he confirms), "Start your training" button, then Where (address, directions) and When (published times) |
| `Journey` | `components/sections` | Ink band: eyebrow, display headline and intro beside a before/after pair (4:5 frames, greyscale, paper "Before"/"After" tags), optional big-number highlights (currently none: the follower count is in About), then numbered chapters. Content in `content/journey.ts`; hidden until confirmed |
| `DemoNotice`, `DemoLabel` | `components/booking/ui.tsx` | Dashed ink frame or ink "DEMO" tag for demonstration content. Never on production |

## Imagery

- Only genuine photos of Alex, his coaching and the venue. No stock, no AI imagery presented as real.
- Hero video (`site.heroVideo`): 4:5, black and white, silent, ~8 s loop of genuine footage — the visual centrepiece. Desktop (lg+): the right half of the grid, width `min(100%, (100svh − 7rem) × 0.8, 44rem)` with the height from the 4:5 ratio (never cropped or stretched), so headline, "Start your training" button and the whole video sit in the first view at 1024×768, 1366×768 and 1440×900 (564×705 px at 1440×900). The headline uses `text-display-split` at lg. Phones (<640 px): the video edge to edge directly under the header (it breaks out of the page gutters with `-mx-4`) at its full 4:5 frame, `object-fit: contain`, never cropped (390×488 on a 390 px phone). The headline (paper), the intro line beneath it (no eyebrow above it) (`site.location.town`: "Expert kettlebell coaching in Cumbernauld. Build strength, improve technique and move with confidence.") and a paper "Start your training" button sit over the lower part of the video on an ink fade (`from-ink/90 via-ink/70 via-65%`; on phones solid `ink` for the bottom 10%, so the video melts into the ink "What I offer" band with no visible edge), so the whole video, headline and button fit the first screen even with Safari's toolbar showing. On phones the headline may start as high as 40% down the video (at 320 px the intro wraps to three lines). The pause button moves to the top right. DOM order (headline, button, video) is unchanged. Below lg the top 22% of the frame fades from `ink` into the footage (`from-ink via-ink/40`), so the ink header and the video read as one block; on tablets a 1.5rem `ink` strip also fills the gap between the header and the video. Both are decorative, `aria-hidden` overlays that change no sizes, and desktop is untouched because the video sits on paper clear of the header. Tablets (640–1023 px) use the same overlay inside the gutters: the video spans the content width, capped at `(100svh − 6.5rem) × 0.8` so the whole frame fits the first screen (720×900 at 768×1024). If no source loads, the poster stays and the pause/play control is removed. Enforced by e2e. Starts on its own as soon as the page opens and loops continuously, except for visitors with Reduce Motion on (changed 2026-10-16 at the project owner's request; previously it played for everyone): they see the poster, painted behind the video and shown by CSS from the first paint, and the play button starts the video. Otherwise: `autoplay muted loop playsinline` are in the server HTML so it starts before JavaScript, and an `ended` handler restarts it in any browser that ignores `loop`. MP4 (H.264) is listed first for reliable looping on Safari/iOS, WebM second. The poster is identical to the first frame and is also the container's background, so a still shows if the video cannot load. A 44 px pause/play button is always shown (WCAG 2.2.2); once paused it stays paused. Devices that block autoplay outright (e.g. iPhone Low Power Mode) show the poster, and the button starts it. The video is decorative (`aria-hidden`); the page must make sense without it.
- Configure in `site.photos`; photos render in greyscale to sit within the monochrome system. Revisit if Alex prefers colour.
- Without photos, layouts are typographic by design (no empty boxes).
- About row: Alex's portrait (`site.photos.about`, supplied 2026-10-17) first, then the first two training stills, so it stays three photos.
- Training stills (`site.trainingStills`): three sharp frames from the hero reel in the About section, staggered on desktop; on phones a swipeable, keyboard-scrollable row (72% wide, the next one peeks in). Frames showing other gyms' branding are excluded. Replace with proper photography when available.
- Page header stills (`site.pageImages`): `/coaching` double-bell swing, `/contact` single-bell hold (cut from the hero loop by `scripts/video_stills.py`, which also repairs the caption-removal patch on the swing frame), `/classes` reuses the group front-rack still. Only sharp frames without other gyms' branding; motion-blurred clips and the "APEX" clips are excluded. Replace with proper photography when available.
- Logo: the supplied artwork is white on black, so the derived PNGs are transparent white (alpha = source luminance) and must sit on **dark surfaces only** (ink header/footer). On a light surface the `Logo` component frames them in an ink tile.
  - Header: monogram mark (36–40 px tall) + the name as written on the artwork, "ALEX.KBELLS" (`site.logo.wordmark`), over "KETTLEBELL COACH" between two short rules, echoing the lockup. Mark only below 360 px and at tablet widths (768–1023 px), where the navigation needs the space; an e2e test checks the header never overlaps.
  - Footer: full lockup, 192–224 px wide.
  - Never redraw, recolour or re-typeset the logo; regenerate from source with `scripts/brand_assets.py`.

## Accessibility requirements

- WCAG 2.2 AA. Semantic landmarks, one h1 per page, skip link, visible `:focus-visible` outline.
- Touch targets ≥ 44 px on phones and tablets (enforced in e2e at 390 and 768 px); inline links in running text are exempt. Native `<details>` for FAQ.
- Repeated "Find out more" links carry screen-reader-only context ("about online coaching").
- Test: axe (automated in e2e), keyboard pass, 320 px reflow, 200% zoom.
