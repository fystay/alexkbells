 * 2. "demo": the guided booking interface with labelled demonstration

 *    or books anything.
 * 3. "request": the guided interface without a calendar: visitors choose a
 *    confirmed class time or their preferred days, and the request is
 *    emailed to Alex, who confirms by reply.
 * 4. "unavailable": honest "Enquire" buttons → /contact. Never a contact page
